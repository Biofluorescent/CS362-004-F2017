	In running my previous unit and card tests, I found a multitude of bugs in my teammate's code. The smithy card results in
one less card in the player's hand than expected along with an extra card in the deck. The village card results in an extra action
for the player than the normal amount. The Salvager card does not properly discard the correct amount of cards. The adventurer card 
results in the incorrect card count for the player deck, oppponent deck, and opponent hand. These errors were all found using the card 
tests I created for the previous assignments. The bugs that cause these errors all seem to be various "off by one" errors in the
refactored code of dominion.
